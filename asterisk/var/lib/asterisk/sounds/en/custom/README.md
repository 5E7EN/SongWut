# System Recordings

The system recordings uploaded via FreePBX GUI are stored at this location. These are the audio clips that are played back to the user during a phone call via the IVR (as defined in the custom dailplan).

They were generated using the "Generative" Matthew voice in Amazon Polly.

Except `boing_boing_test.wav`.
